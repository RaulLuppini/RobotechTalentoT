            <h2>In a nutshell...</h2>
            <p>ROBOTECH is a sweeping science-fiction anime epic of humans defending their homeworld against alien
                domination. The saga is told through the eyes of characters caught up in a series of wars that erupts
                when a
                mysterious spacecraft crash-lands on Earth at the turn of the millenium. The secrets of alien knowledge
                aboard this vessel were unlocked, leading to the development of "Robotechnology" and the creation of a
                vast
                arsenal of robotic "mecha" to defend the Earth against the alien threats that would eventually strike to
                lay
                claim to the mysterious power source known as "protoculture."

                ROBOTECH has often been called a "space opera" because it is not just action-packed entertainment, but
                also
                an engaging drama.</p>

            <h3>Synopsis of the Macross Saga</h3>
            <p>
                ROBOTECH is a sweeping science-fiction anime epic of humans defending their homeworld against alien
                domination.<br>


                1999<br>

                The alien spaceship crashes on Earth, effectively ending nearly a decade of global civil war. Originally
                called "The Visitor", the ship is renamed Super Dimensional Fortress, better known by its acronym SDF-1.
                The spaceship destroys many cities due to its shockwave before crashing into Macross Island.<br>

                Dr. Emil Lang, after an initial reconnaissance of the ship (in the company of Roy Fokker, Henry Gloval,
                T.R. Edwards and others), begins to reveal the secrets of an alien science known as Robotech. Macross
                Island becomes the focal point of Robotechnology, and reconstruction begins on the SDF-1.<br>

                The Denver Six Complex is built within the Colorado mountains for US leaders in the event of a
                thermonuclear war, but is later abandoned.<br>

                2002<br>
                In a confrontation with Zentraedis ships, the Sara Base on Mars is destroyed. Lisa Hayes' fiancé, Carl
                Riber, is killed along with the rest of the base's personnel, concluding the battle in total
                annihilation. Lisa turns 17.<br>

                Development of the reconfigurable Veritech Fighter begins.<br>

                In Tyrol, Cabell "creates" Rem through tissue cloned from Zor. The Masters, too, make progress with
                Zor's body, cloning tissue for their own purposes and extracting from the scientist's residual cellular
                memories a vision of Earth, the destination of the fortress and matrix of the Protoculture he had stolen
                and had encouraged because of his understanding.<br>

                2003-08<br>
                The United Earth Defense Council (UEDC) is created, under the leadership of Senator Alfonso Napoleón
                Russo, Admiral Hayes, Colonel T.R. Edwards et al. A secret base is built in Alaska with Robottechnology,
                which will become the Grand Canyon.<br>

                Roy Fokker and Claudia Grant quickly become lovers.<br>

                Lisa Hayes is assigned to the SDF-1 project in Macross, under the command of Captain Henry Gloval.<br>

                Tommy Luan is elected mayor of Macross City.<br>

                Formation of the Robotech Defense Force --RDF (Robotech Defense Force).<br>

                2009<br>
                On the day of the SDF-1's launch, the Zentraedi (after a ten-year quest to find Zor's battle fortress
                and the missing Protoculture array) appear in the solar system and attack Macross Island. After the
                attack on Macross Island, the fortress performs a hyperspace jump at mid-altitude above the island but
                accidentally appears in Pluto's orbit, taking the aircraft carriers Prometheus and Daedalus, Macross
                Island and its population, of around 75,000 people, with them. with him. 15-year-old Lynn Minmei and
                19-year-old Rick Hunter are caught in the fortress transposition. Space Battle Platforms Armor One and
                Ten along with Earth's orbital defenses are destroyed by the Zentraedi. Lisa Hayes turns 24 years
                old.<br>
